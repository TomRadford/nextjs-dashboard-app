## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

Running db from Vercel Postgres (neon db) is a mission, just run `pnpm db:up` then hit the `/seed` endpoint ;)

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.
